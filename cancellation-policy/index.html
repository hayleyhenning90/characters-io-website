        <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="policy-intro">We understand that plans can change, and we do our best to accommodate our clients fairly. However, due to the preparation and staffing involved, all cancellations are subject to the following policies.</p>

        <h2>Standard Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>All deposits are non-refundable.</strong> Deposits secure your performer and costume for the event and reserve a time slot on our calendar that cannot be rebooked.</li>
          <li>If you cancel, we are happy to <strong>hold your deposit as a credit</strong> for a future party. This credit does not expire for up to 1 year and can be used toward any future booking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Last-Minute Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Bookings cancelled <strong>within 24 hours of the event</strong> are non-refundable, and no credit will be issued. This includes cases where clients simply change their mind or fail to confirm party details.</li>
          <li>If your event is canceled due to an emergency or legitimate issue, we may offer to apply the full amount as a credit on a case-by-case basis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Performer-Requested Cancellations or Substitutions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If a requested performer is sick or unavailable, we will do our best to provide a suitable replacement. We do not guarantee specific performers due to extenuating circumstances, illness, and unavailability.</li>
          <li>If a character is unable to attend due to illness or emergency, we will contact you immediately and offer a replacement or a full refund.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changing Characters or Time</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not offer refunds because you wish to reduce your character count or shorten your event after booking. These changes will be treated as a cancellation of part of your reservation.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> If you booked 3 characters and wish to downgrade to 2, we do not refund the 3rd - instead, you can apply that portion as credit for a future event.</li>
          <li><strong>Time Changes:</strong> You can request a change to your event time with at least 48 hours' notice, subject to availability.</li>
          <li><strong>Character Swaps:</strong> We will try our best to accommodate character swaps before the event, but cannot guarantee availability without advance notice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Good Faith Measures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you're canceling shortly after booking (within 24 hours of payment) and the event is weeks away, we may offer you a full credit or partial refund, depending on availability and fairness. This is not guaranteed and must be discussed with our team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Weather Policy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Characters cannot perform in rain or extreme heat. An <strong>indoor backup location is required</strong> for all outdoor events.</li>
          <li>If weather prevents the event and no indoor option is available, we will work with you to reschedule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dissatisfaction Claims</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you cancel due to dissatisfaction with a performer's appearance or execution, we must be informed <strong>during the event</strong> to give us the opportunity to resolve it.</li>
          <li>After the event is completed, no full refunds will be issued.</li>
          <li>Please contact us directly before leaving a review. We are eager to resolve any issues and provide excellent customer service.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="policy-note">
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> We reserve the right to deny refunds if a client proceeds with the event and then claims dissatisfaction without notifying us during the party. Our performers work hard to create magical experiences and deserve a chance to make it right in real time.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
