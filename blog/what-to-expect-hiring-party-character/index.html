          <p>You've decided to make your child's birthday extra special by <strong>hiring a party character</strong>. Whether it's a princess, superhero, or beloved mascot, professional character entertainment can transform an ordinary party into an unforgettable experience.</p>

          <p>But if you've never booked a character before, you might have questions. What exactly happens? How should you prepare? What do you get for your money?</p>

          <p>This guide walks you through every step of the party character experience, from booking to the magical goodbye.</p>

          <h2 id="booking-process">The Booking Process</h2>

          <p>Booking a party character is straightforward, but here's what to expect:</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Character</h3>

          <p>Browse available characters on the company's website. At Characters.io, we offer over 100 characters including <a href="/characters/princesses/">princesses</a>, <a href="/characters/superheroes/">superheroes</a>, <a href="/characters/mascots/">mascots</a>, and <a href="/characters/storybook/">storybook characters</a>. Consider what your child loves most—their face lighting up when their favorite character arrives is priceless.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Select Date, Time, and Duration</h3>

          <p>Most packages start with a 1-hour minimum. For parties with more than 15 children or if you want time for multiple activities, consider 90 minutes or 2 hours. Peak times (Saturday afternoons) book fastest, so have backup dates ready.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Provide Party Details</h3>

          <p>You'll share information like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Party address and venue type (home, park, venue)</li>
            <li>Birthday child's name and age</li>
            <li>Number of guests expected</li>
            <li>Any special requests or details about your child</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 4: Confirmation</h3>

          <p>After booking, you'll receive confirmation with your character's arrival time, what to expect, and contact information. Reputable companies like ours also send a reminder before your event.</p>

          <div class="callout callout--tip">
            <p class="callout__title">Booking Tip</p>
            <p>Book 2-4 weeks in advance for best availability. Popular characters like <a href="/characters/princesses/elsa/">Elsa</a> and <a href="/characters/superheroes/spider-man/">Spider-Man</a> fill up quickly, especially for weekends.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="before-party">Before the Party</h2>

          <p>In the days leading up to your party:</p>

          <h3>A Few Days Before</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confirm arrival time:</strong> The character typically arrives 5-10 minutes before their scheduled appearance time to make a grand entrance</li>
            <li><strong>Plan the entrance:</strong> Decide where the character will enter and where children will be gathered</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare a private area:</strong> The performer may need a room to change or touch up their costume</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Day of the Party</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear the entrance path:</strong> Make sure the character can enter without navigating obstacles</li>
            <li><strong>Brief other adults:</strong> Let grandparents, other parents, and helpers know when to expect the character</li>
            <li><strong>Charge your phone:</strong> You'll want to capture every magical moment!</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="character-arrival">When the Character Arrives</h2>

          <p>Here's where the magic happens:</p>

          <h3>The Grand Entrance</h3>

          <p>Professional performers know how to make an entrance. Typically, the character will:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Arrive a few minutes early and wait in a designated area</li>
            <li>Make a grand entrance when cued (you can signal them via text)</li>
            <li>Greet the birthday child first by name</li>
            <li>Acknowledge all the children with excitement and wonder</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Watching children's faces transform from curiosity to pure joy is one of the best parts of hiring a character. Many kids truly believe they're meeting the real princess or superhero.</p>

          <h3>First Few Minutes</h3>

          <p>The character will introduce themselves, compliment the decorations, and begin building rapport with the children. Experienced performers read the room—if kids are shy, they'll warm them up gradually. If kids are excited and energetic, they'll match that energy.</p>

          <h2 id="during-party">What Happens During the Party</h2>

          <p>A professional character visit is structured to maximize engagement and create memories. Here's a typical flow:</p>

          <h3>Activities and Entertainment (40-50 minutes)</h3>

          <p>The character leads age-appropriate activities:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Singing:</strong> Princesses sing their signature songs; superheroes might lead chants</li>
            <li><strong>Games:</strong> Freeze dance, musical chairs, trivia about the character's movie</li>
            <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Many characters share a story or adventure</li>
            <li><strong>Face painting or tattoos:</strong> If included in your package</li>
            <li><strong>Special ceremonies:</strong> Princess face paintings, superhero training, etc.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Photo Opportunities (10-15 minutes)</h3>

          <p>Individual photos with each child, group photos, and special shots with the birthday child. This is often where the most treasured memories are captured.</p>

          <h3>Cake Time</h3>

          <p>Many families time the cake cutting to coincide with the character's visit. The character can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lead the birthday song</li>
            <li>Help the birthday child make a wish</li>
            <li>Pose for photos during candle blowing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Farewell</h3>

          <p>The character will say a magical goodbye, often leaving the children with a special message or mission. This helps children transition smoothly rather than being sad about the departure.</p>

          <h2 id="what-included">What's Typically Included</h2>

          <p>Standard party character packages generally include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Professional performer</strong> in high-quality, screen-accurate costume</li>
            <li><strong>Character-appropriate entertainment</strong> (singing, games, activities)</li>
            <li><strong>Photo opportunities</strong> with all guests</li>
            <li><strong>Special attention</strong> to the birthday child</li>
            <li><strong>Coronation or special ceremony</strong> (for princess characters)</li>

          <h2 id="preparing-kids">Preparing Your Child</h2>

          <h3>To Surprise or Not to Surprise?</h3>

          <p>This is one of the most common questions parents ask. There's no right answer—it depends on your child:</p>

          <p><strong>Keep it a surprise if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your child handles excitement well</li>
            <li>They're confident and outgoing</li>
            <li>You want to capture their genuine reaction</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Tell them in advance if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your child is shy or anxious around strangers</li>
            <li>They might be overwhelmed by surprise</li>
            <li>They're very young (2-3 years old)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>For Shy Children</h3>

          <p>If your child is on the shy side:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Let them know a special visitor is coming</li>
            <li>Watch videos of the character beforehand</li>
            <li>Reassure them they don't have to interact immediately</li>
            <li>Have them sit near you when the character arrives</li>
            <li>Let the performer know in advance—they're trained to warm up hesitant children</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="tips-success">Tips for a Successful Character Visit</h2>

          <h3>Do:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep the character's identity secret from kids</strong>—don't refer to them as "the performer" or talk about costumes</li>
            <li><strong>Have your camera ready</strong>—the best photos happen naturally throughout the visit</li>
            <li><strong>Let the character lead</strong>—they're professionals and know how to engage kids</li>
            <li><strong>Stay present</strong>—enjoy watching the magic happen!</li>
            <li><strong>Tip if exceptional</strong>—while not required, tips are appreciated for outstanding service</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Don't:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ask the character to break character</strong>—they stay in role the entire time</li>
            <li><strong>Overwhelm them with adult conversation</strong>—their focus is the children</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule the character during meal time</strong>—kids can't eat and engage at the same time</li>
            <li><strong>Worry if your child is shy at first</strong>—most warm up within minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

              </summary>
              <p class="article-faq__answer">Most party character packages include 1-2 hours of entertainment. The first hour is typically the most popular option, with additional 30-minute increments available. For larger parties or events with more guests, 90 minutes to 2 hours is recommended.</p>

              </summary>
              <p class="article-faq__answer">This depends on your child. Many parents keep it as a surprise for maximum impact. However, if your child is shy or anxious around new people, letting them know beforehand can help them feel prepared and excited rather than overwhelmed.</p>

              </summary>
              <p class="article-faq__answer">Professional party characters engage with all children at the party, not just the birthday child. They lead group activities, take photos with everyone, and ensure all kids feel included in the magic. The birthday child receives special attention during key moments like the face painting or gift opening.</p>

              </summary>
              <p class="article-faq__answer">Experienced performers know how to handle shy or nervous children. They typically enter calmly (not rushing toward children), maintain appropriate distance until children are comfortable, and never force interactions. If a child remains uncomfortable, they can still enjoy watching from a distance while other children interact.</p>

              </summary>
              <p class="article-faq__answer">Yes! When booking, you can share special requests. Most characters can accommodate specific songs, games, or moments you'd like included. Just mention them during booking so the performer can prepare.</p>
