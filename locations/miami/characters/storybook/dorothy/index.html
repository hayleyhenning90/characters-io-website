          <h2>The Ultimate Wizard of Oz Birthday Party Experience</h2>
          <p>When you hire Dorothy from Characters.io, you're getting more than a costume character&mdash;you're booking a professionally trained performer who brings L. Frank Baum's beloved heroine to life. Our Dorothy entertainers have studied the character extensively, perfecting her kind heart, brave spirit, and genuine warmth that made her a timeless American icon.</p>

          <p>Every detail matters when creating an authentic Oz party experience. Our Dorothy costume is a premium, screen-accurate recreation of the iconic blue and white gingham dress with matching blue ribbons in her braided pigtails. The sparkling ruby slippers are the centerpiece&mdash;they catch the light beautifully and photograph wonderfully, ensuring your party pictures look absolutely magical.</p>

          <p>What sets our Dorothy apart is her heartfelt storytelling and engaging activities. Children are captivated as she shares tales of her adventures through the Land of Oz, teaches them the magic of friendship, and leads them on their own Yellow Brick Road journey. Her warm personality and genuine kindness make every child feel special, brave, and reminded that there truly is no place like home.</p>

          <h3>Perfect for Classic Themed Birthday Parties</h3>
          <p>A Wizard of Oz birthday party is a beloved classic for children ages 3-10. Our Dorothy character appearance transforms any venue&mdash;your home, a park, a party venue, or anywhere you're celebrating&mdash;into a magical journey over the rainbow. She arrives in character with Toto, greets the birthday child as a new friend, and spends the entire visit creating enchanting moments.</p>

          <p>The ruby slipper activities are always a highlight. Dorothy teaches children how to click their heels three times while making heartfelt wishes. Then she leads the group through rainbow games, Yellow Brick Road adventures, and sing-alongs that transport children into the magical world of Oz. It's perfect for rainbow-themed parties, classic movie celebrations, and anyone who loves timeless stories!</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Dorothy party packages start at $275 for a 1-hour appearance, with 2-hour packages available for larger celebrations. Pricing varies by location, date (weekends vs. weekdays), and any add-on services like face painting or balloon twisting. Peak season dates (spring and summer weekends) may have adjusted rates.

          <summary class="faq__question">Does Dorothy bring Toto to the party?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Yes! Dorothy always arrives with her beloved Toto companion. Toto is a realistic plush dog in a basket that children absolutely love. He's included in photos, activities, and becomes part of the whole Oz experience. Children often ask to hold Toto and give him pets&mdash;it's one of the sweetest parts of the party!</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">What ages is Dorothy best for?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Our Dorothy character is perfect for children ages 3-10, with the sweet spot being 4-8 year olds who love classic stories and adventure. That said, Wizard of Oz has multigenerational appeal&mdash;grandparents often love seeing Dorothy as much as the kids! Our performers are skilled at engaging all ages with warmth and kindness.</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">How far in advance should I book Dorothy for my party?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>We recommend booking 2-3 weeks in advance for the best availability. Dorothy is a popular character, and weekend dates fill up quickly&mdash;especially during spring birthday season (March-May) and summer. For holiday weekends or December dates, we suggest booking 4-6 weeks ahead. Last-minute bookings are sometimes possible on weekdays.</p>
