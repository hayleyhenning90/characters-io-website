          <h2>The Ultimate Toy Story Cowgirl Birthday Party Experience</h2>
          <p>When you hire Jessie from Characters.io, you're getting more than a costume character&mdash;you're booking a professionally trained performer who brings the yodeling cowgirl to life. Our Jessie entertainers have studied the character extensively, perfecting her energetic personality, brave spirit, and infectious enthusiasm that makes her so beloved.</p>

          <p>Every detail matters when creating authentic Toy Story party entertainment. Our Jessie costume is a premium, screen-accurate recreation of the iconic cowgirl look&mdash;the signature red cowgirl hat with white lace trim, yellow blouse with cow-print accents, cow-print chaps, and her famous long red braid. The costume photographs wonderfully, ensuring your party pictures capture the spirit of Toy Story.</p>

          <p>What sets our Jessie apart is her genuine high-energy connection with kids. Children are captivated as she shares stories about her adventures with Woody and Bullseye, teaches them yodeling and line dancing, and shows them that cowgirls can do anything. Her brave, can-do attitude inspires kids and makes every child feel special.</p>

          <h3>Perfect for Toy Story-Themed Birthday Parties</h3>
          <p>A Toy Story birthday party with Jessie is a beloved theme for children ages 3-8. Our Jessie character appearance transforms any venue&mdash;your home, a park, a party venue, or a backyard&mdash;into the wild west world of Woody's Roundup. She arrives in character, greets the birthday child as a fellow cowgirl or cowboy, and spends the entire visit creating cowgirl adventures.</p>

          <p>The yodeling performance is always a highlight. Jessie gathers all the children together and shows off her famous yodeling skills, then teaches kids how to yodel along with her. Then she leads the group in cowgirl games, line dancing, and an exciting roundup adventure that children will talk about for weeks.</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">How much does it cost to hire Jessie for a birthday party?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Jessie party packages start at $275 for a 1-hour appearance, with 2-hour packages available for larger celebrations. Pricing varies by location, date (weekends vs. weekdays), and any add-on services like face painting or balloon twisting. Peak season dates (spring and summer weekends) may have adjusted rates.

          <summary class="faq__question">Does your Jessie actually yodel?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Yes! Our Jessie performers are trained to yodel just like the beloved character from Toy Story. The yodeling performance is always a party highlight&mdash;kids love watching Jessie show off her skills and then trying to yodel along with her. It's a fun, interactive moment that gets everyone laughing and cheering.</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">What ages is Jessie best for?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Our Jessie character is perfect for children ages 3-8, with the sweet spot being kids who love Toy Story and high-energy fun. That said, our performers are skilled at engaging all ages&mdash;from younger toddlers who might be a little shy to older kids who want to hear about Jessie's adventures. Her energetic personality appeals to anyone who loves cowgirl adventures!</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">How far in advance should I book Jessie for my party?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>We recommend booking 2-3 weeks in advance for the best availability. Jessie is a popular character, especially for Toy Story-themed parties, and weekend dates fill up quickly during birthday season (spring and summer). For holiday weekends or December dates, we suggest booking 4-6 weeks ahead. Last-minute bookings are sometimes possible on weekdays.</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">Can I book Jessie with Woody or Buzz Lightyear?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Absolutely! Booking Jessie with Woody is a magical combination that brings the Toy Story cowboy duo to life. Together they recreate the beloved roundup adventures, lead games, and create twice the excitement. We also offer Jessie paired with Buzz Lightyear, or you can book all three for a complete Toy Story celebration that kids will never forget.</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">What does Jessie do during the party?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>A typical 1-hour Jessie visit includes: an energetic cowgirl entrance in character, special greeting for the birthday child (who becomes an honorary member of Woody's Roundup gang), yodeling performance with singalong, cowgirl games like stick horse races and roundup adventures, line dancing lessons, photo opportunities with all guests, and helping with the birthday cake and candles with her signature enthusiasm. For 2-hour packages, we add more games, storytime about her adventures, and additional activities.</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Yes, absolutely. Every Characters.io performer undergoes a comprehensive background check before working with us. We also carry full liability insurance for every event. Your family's safety and peace of mind is our top priority. All performers are also trained in child engagement and safety protocols.</p>
