          <h2>The Ultimate Latina Princess Birthday Party Experience</h2>
          <p>When you hire Elena of Avalor from Characters.io, you're getting more than a costume character&mdash;you're booking a professionally trained performer who brings the brave crown princess to life. Our Elena entertainers are actresses who have studied the series extensively, perfecting Elena's voice, her adventurous spirit, courageous leadership, and warm celebration of Latina heritage.</p>

          <p>Every detail matters when creating authentic princess party entertainment. Our Elena costume is a premium, screen-accurate recreation featuring her iconic red flowing gown with gold accents, her royal scepter, and beautiful accessories that children recognize and love from the beloved Disney series. The costume photographs beautifully, ensuring your party pictures look magical.</p>

          <p>What sets our Elena apart is her bilingual abilities and cultural authenticity. Our Elena performers can incorporate Spanish phrases, songs, and cultural elements that make Latino families feel seen and celebrated. She represents courage, family values, and the importance of learning from mistakes&mdash;lessons that resonate with children of all backgrounds.</p>

          <h3>Perfect for Cultural Celebrations and Birthday Parties</h3>
          <p>An Elena of Avalor birthday party is perfect for children ages 4-10 who love adventure and strong princess characters. Our Elena character appearance transforms any venue&mdash;your home, a park, a party venue, or a community center&mdash;into the magical kingdom of Avalor. She arrives in character, greets the birthday child as a special royal friend, and spends the entire visit creating adventurous memories.</p>

          <p>The royal leadership activities are always a highlight. Elena teaches children about courage and making good decisions, leads exciting adventure games and quests, and shares stories of her kingdom. Then she leads the group in Latin-inspired dance celebrations, treasure hunts through Avalor, and festive activities that honor her cultural heritage.</p>

          <summary class="faq__question">What ages is Elena of Avalor best for?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Our Elena character is perfect for children ages 4-10, with the sweet spot being 5-9 year olds who love adventure and the Elena of Avalor series.

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Yes! Our Elena performers are bilingual and can incorporate Spanish phrases, greetings, songs, and cultural elements into the party experience.

          <summary class="faq__question">How far in advance should I book Elena of Avalor?</summary>
          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>We recommend booking 2-3 weeks in advance for the best availability. Elena is a popular princess character, and weekend dates fill up quickly&mdash;especially during spring birthday season (March-May) and summer. For holiday weekends, Dia de los Muertos, Hispanic Heritage Month, or December dates, we suggest booking 4-6 weeks ahead.</p>

          <div class="faq__answer">
            <p>Absolutely! Elena pairs wonderfully with other adventurous princess characters. Our most popular pairing is Elena with Mirabel from Encanto for a celebration of Latina heritage and family. She also pairs beautifully with Moana for an adventurous duo, or with Jasmine for a magical princess combination. Contact us for duo package pricing.</p>
